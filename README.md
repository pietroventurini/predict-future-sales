# Description
The notebooks in this repository contain the code I wrote to solve the Kaggle competition ["Predict Future Sales"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales), a machine learning competition in which we have to deal with time series data about sales in order to predict future sales for shop-product pairs.

I highly recommend to use Google Colab to run the notebooks by clicking on the badge [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]() that can be found at the beginning of each notebook.

In order for the code to work, the datesets must be placed into the folder `./datasets`. Those files weigh a total of about 97Mb and can be found in the competition [data section](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data).

### Notebooks:
1. [Exploratory Data Analyisis + Feature Engineering](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LAlml5mQZEdP0JpQU8AUndb7u-jsi-uB?usp=sharing)
2. [Model Training + Evaluation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sdxvVosUzO6lUGhuoU-T-2W3_HJQ6qcH?usp=sharing)

The current model placed in the **top 4%** of the leaderboard, precisely around 400th over more than 10000 teams.
